During the implementation of the multi-class producer-consumer synchronization system, several challenges were encountered. In this section, we outline the key challenges faced and discuss the strategies employed to address them.

\section{Challenge 1: Synchronization}

One of the primary challenges was achieving effective synchronization among the multiple processes, ensuring that producers and consumers operate correctly without data inconsistencies.

\textbf{Solution:} We implemented semaphore-based synchronization to control access to the shared memory. This approach helped in preventing race conditions and maintaining the integrity of the data.

\section{Challenge 2: Shared Memory Access}

Managing shared memory access and preventing conflicts between processes accessing the shared buffer posed a significant challenge.

\textbf{Solution:} Careful consideration was given to the order of operations, and the use of semaphores was extended to manage access to shared memory. This helped in avoiding conflicts and maintaining the class-based constraints.

\section{Challenge 3: Reading from a File}

Introducing file-based message generation for producers added complexity to the system, requiring adjustments in data flow and synchronization.

\textbf{Solution:} The producer function was modified to read messages from a file and generate messages based on class constraints. Semaphores continued to play a crucial role in ensuring proper synchronization.
