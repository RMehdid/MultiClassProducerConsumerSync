\section{Problem}
In this task, we aim to implement a solution for the multi-class producer-consumer synchronization problem. Four producers (P1, P2, P3, P4) and two consumers (C1, C2) share a common buffer.\\
The challenge is to synchronize access to the buffer, ensuring adherence to class-specific constraints (P1/P2 in CL1, P3/P4 in CL2, C1/C2 consume messages from their respective classes).

\section{Approach}
To address the multi-class producer-consumer synchronization problem, we have implemented a solution using shared memory and semaphores in the C programming language. The approach involves creating shared memory for the buffer and employing semaphores to synchronize access to this shared resource.

Each producer process now reads messages from a messages.txt file and generates messages for its respective class. Each consumer process is responsible for consuming messages from the shared buffer. Semaphores are utilized to coordinate the access of processes to the buffer, preventing conflicts and ensuring that the specified constraints are met.
